# Introduction To Dynamic Programming
Presentation for junior students introducing them to basic dynamic programming concepts.

1. What is dynamic programming?
  - The basic idea of dynamic programming is to take a problem, split it into sub problems. solve those sub problems and reuse the solution to your sub problems. AKA memoization.
  - You can think of dynamic programming as a sort of exhaustive search.
  - One way to think of DP is careful brute force.
